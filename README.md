# **Web Site for BTE311 Web Development Course**

This project is a website developed for the **BTE311 Web Development** course. The website was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **PHP**. The website was developed week by week throughout the semester, with new features added every week according to the assignments given. During this process, I gradually applied the web development skills I learned.

## **Project Features**

- 🌐 **HTML Structure**: I created the building blocks of the web pages using HTML5 and structured the content.
- 🎨 **CSS Styling**: The visual design of the pages was crafted using CSS3, establishing the layout and style of the site.
- ⚙️ **PHP Dynamic Features**: I used PHP to create dynamic content for forms, user management, and database interactions.
